    "## 1 Purpose of the Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to examine a variety of \"systems under test\" in which a current $i(t)$ flows through the system and we measure the resulting potential difference $v(t)$ across the system. In particular, we will examine important cases where there is a linear response of the potential to an imposed (co-)sinusoidally varying current where the magnitude and phase of the response can be measured as a function of frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the system-under-test will literally be a black box containing some simple combination of a resistor, capacitor, and/or inductor. Then we will explore a particular combination of these components that we claim represents the behavior of living tissue. Eventually, we plan to take a step closer to real living materials by using a biological sample (potato slice) whose internal structure gives it an interesting impedance response. This takes us close to the possibility of using such techniques for examining human tissue. The methods you are exploring here are in fact now used in medical diagnostics, including the detection of cancer. See the section: \"Point of Departure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to measure the relationship between potential difference and current, both in terms of amplitude and phase, we will introduce a new type of instrument: the lock-in amplifier. This device has both digital and analog displays that directly give these two pieces of information: amplitude and phase. However, the function of the lock-in amplifier goes far beyond this: it is capable of filtering the signal it measures in such a way that it eliminates most of any interfering noise, and thus is a very useful instrument when the currents and potentials are extremely weak and would otherwise be obscured by noise in the system. Initially, we won't need to use weak signals, but in the later part of the experiment where we simulate the measurement of current-voltage characteristics of living tissue, there will be a reduction in signal strength in order to represent physiological conditions - conditions that can also give rise to noisy interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal is to gain deep insight into the response of materials to electric fields, where the response includes current flow, electric polarization, and consequent effects on potential drop across a material. These effects determine the electric impedance of the material (defined below), and especially in how the impedance depends on frequency. The details of such dependence contains information not only about the constituent matter but also about the internal structure of a complex medium (tissue, battery, other). Thus the method called \"impedance spectroscopy\", like its optical counterpart (visible light spectroscopy), uses measurement of the frequency dependence of the response to a probe (injected current) to obtain fundamental insight into a physical system.

    "As noted above, the experiment will explore the relationship between the electric current $i(t)$ flowing through a system under test and the scalar potential difference $v(t)$ across that system. We will consider the behavior when a (co-)sinusoidal current is imposed with angular frequency $\\omega$ radians/second. We'll choose the origin of time $t = 0$ so that at that time the current has zero phase shift in the cosine function:\n",

    "\n",
    "These ideas are important because we can use elegant methods to solve the system in complex form and then take only the real parts at the end to represent the obseved potential and current, since observed quantities are real numbers.\n",

Using complex representations and impedances may seem to be \"much ado about nothing\", since it is possible to find the potential $v(t)$ across simple resistors, capacitors, or inductors by direct solution of simple algebraic or differential equations.

    "Complex multiplication requires distributing the individual products and using the fact that \n",

    "$$ z_1 \\times z_2 = (x_1+jy_1)(x_2+jy_2) = x_1x_2 + j(x_1y_2 + x_2y_1) + j^2y_1y_2 = (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2) +  j(x_1y_2 + x_2y_1).$$\n",

    "\n",
    "A very important idea is the representation of a complex number by a point in a plane. The coordinate on the horizontal axis is $x$ and the coordinate long the vertical axis is $y$. The magnitude $|z|$ is the magnitude of the vector pointing from the origin to the point with coordinates $(x,y)$ and the phase $\\phi$ is the angle the vector makes with the horizontal axis, where a positive value is taken for counterclockwise rotation.\n",

    "An important concept about complex numbers is an identify for the exponential function of an imaginary number called Euler's formula:\n",
