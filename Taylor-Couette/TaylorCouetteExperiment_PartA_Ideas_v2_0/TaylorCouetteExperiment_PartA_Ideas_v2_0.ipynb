    "## 1.0 Introduction and Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor-Couette experiment examines fluid flow between independently rotating cylinders. It is, in many respects, the \"hydrogen atom\" of fluid mechanics. By reducing the experimental  configuration to as fundamental a geometry and composition as possible, it is possible to make very precise measurements and do exacting tests of underlying theories. Astonishingly, despite the simplicity of the geometry, the system exhibits a very wide range of dynamical phenomena over the range of paramater variations that can be employed. Even when the outer cylinder is kept at rest, an increase in speed of the inner cylinder leads to a progression of flow states of increasing complexity in both space and time...ultimately producing highly turbulent flow that continues to be a focus of research in the field of fluid mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the most fundamental flow state achieved in this system at low cylinder speeds and the observation that this state becomes unstable when critical values of the cylinder speeds are reached through careful control using computers. Flow visualization is a primary experimental technique that allows us to directly see and quantify features of the flow that develops when instability occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ideas of this experiment can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 The flow between two independently rotating co-axial cylinders has an exact solution to the equation of motion for moving fluids subject to \"no-slip boundary conditions\": the flow velocity much match the velocity of any walls with which it is in contact at the locations of the walls. Here the equation of motion, Newton's second law for fluids, is written as the *Navier-Stokes equation:* it expresses how the time variation of the flow velocity field is related to spatial derivatives of the velocity field and to forces imposed on the fluid, including viscous stresses due to internal friction within the moving fluid. In describing fluid motion, this equation must be accompanied by an equation of local conservation of mass (the \"continuity equation\") which for incompressible fluids is simply that the velocity field has zero divergence. You will see how the exact solition to these equations can be derived and how its coefficience are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 The exact solution described above can become unstable to small perturbations to the velocity field. This happens when, for a given rotational speed $\\Omega_2$ of the outer cylinder, the rotational spped of the inner cylinder $\\Omega_1$ reaches a critical value $\\Omega_{1c}$. This critical value is typically expressed in terms of a critical value of the $Re_{c1}$ of the corresponding *Reynolds number* (Re) that is a dimensionless parameter defining the conditions imposed on the fluid. The definition of Reynolds number and its physical meaning will be explored in the discussion below. When instability occurs, a new flow state evolves with a pattern that has a spatial periodicity in the axial direction. This periodicity is typically expressed in terms of a \"critical wavenumber\" $k_c$ that appears in mathematical representations of the spatial periodicity of the perturbation to which the original flow state is most sensitive. We say that the original simple flow state has undergone a \"pattern forming instability\" and flow visualization techniques will be used to reveal and quantify the resulting patterns."

    "### 1.4.1 Gravitational force\n",
    "One type of force, a body force like gravity, is due to some outside agency (e.g. earth's gravitational field) acting on any parcel of fluid. We can let the vector $\\vec g$ represent the both the direction and the magnitude g of the force per unit mass due to gravity. Then the gravitational force acting on the fluid element with density $\\rho$ is\n",

This is Newton's model for viscous stresses.\n",

Suppose an area element $dA$ has a vector normal to the area with magnitude equal to the area $dA$ and components $(dA_1,dA_2, dA_3)$.

    "### 1.9.2 A heuristic estimate of a critical rotation speed for instability of a viscous fluid\n",
    "\n",
    "The above inviscid criterion can be improved to account for viscous effects and arrive at new criterion that requires a nonzero critical inner cylinder angular velocity for a given outer cyclinder rotation, including zero. We will find that there must be enough outward force acting on a displaced fluid element to overcome losses induced by viscosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will assert that the imbalance between the centripetal force required to maintain a displaced fluid ring in rotation and the actual local pressure gradient is opposed by viscous drag. Under this condition a terminal radial velocity will be reached as the ring exands outward. If the time for the ring to move a distance comparable to its (small) radius is equal to or longer than the time within which viscosity causes the relative motion between the ring and surround fluid to damp out, i.e. to diffuse away, then the flow remains stable because the excess angular momentum is diffused away. This will become our new stability criterion.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the outer cyclinder rotates opposite from the inner cylinder, $Re_2 < 0$, calculations find that when $Re_2$ reaches a special \"co-dimension-2\" value $Re_{2}^{(0->1)}$ where the instability changes to give rise to an azimuhtal wavenumber $m=1$. THe resulting flow is called *spiral vortex flow* and looks like a moving barber pole. This spiral vortex flow is retained for even more negative values for $Re_2$ until another \"co-dimension-2\" value $Re_{2}^{(1->2)}$ where the azimuthal wavenumber jumps from 1 to 2 and a steeper spiral vortex flow is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The terminology \"codimension-2 refers to the fact that two independent parameters  must be varied to explore a particular type of transition, here one in which more than one mode of new flow is in competition.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interesting dynamics is observed very close to the co-dimension-2 points because multiple modes are competing. Special mathematical theory has predicted a wide variety of interesting phenomena in these regions, including a new flow which looks like undulating Taylor vortices and other flows that include chaotic flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and importantly, careful investigation has uncovered a possibility that more than one minimum can exist in the marginal stability curve of $Re_1$ versus $k$. At very special values of the governing parameters $\\eta$ and $\\mu$ these minima have equal depth and there will be a competition of different *axial* wavenumbers. This prediction is now under active investigation by students in our laboratories.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Marginal stability curve with double minimum](./Figures/DoubleMinimumMarginalStabilityCurve.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> FIGURE: marginal stability curves for a radius ratio $\\eta = 0.640$ and a speed rati $\\mu = -1.400$. Here $\\epsilon \\equiv \\frac{Re_1-Re_{1c}}{Re_{1c}}$ where the predicted $Re_{1c} = 246.3$ and $m_c = 2$. Now there are two values $k_{c1}d = 3.628$ $k_{c2}d = 6.896$ with respective values $\\frac{\\omega_{c1}}{\\Omega_1} = 0.7072$ and $\\frac{\\omega_{c2}}{\\Omega_1} = 0.7005$. (Thus, for the given value of $\\mu$ and $Re_{1c}$, we must have $Re_2 = -538.8$.)"
